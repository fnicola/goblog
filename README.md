A simple blog written in Go
===========================

Quickstart
----------
    git clone https://github.com/fnicola/goblog.git
    cd goblog
    go build

Then open your browser at the page
    [http://localhost:8080/view/](http://localhost:8080/view/)

One entry is a file .md inside the folder content.
Currently I support only one tag for entry.
